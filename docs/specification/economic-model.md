# Charter City — Economic Model

**Licensed Occupation, Revenue Sustainability, and Retirement Funding**

## 1. Foundational Principle: No Ownership

All property in the city is owned by the city entity. Residents do not buy, own, or accumulate equity in their housing. Instead, they hold an **occupation license** — a renewable agreement granting the right to occupy a specific unit under defined terms.

This is not a cosmetic distinction from renting. The license model gives the city structural advantages that conventional landlord-tenant relationships do not:

- **Planning authority** — The city can reallocate space, redevelop, or densify without eminent domain proceedings, holdout negotiations, or property rights litigation.
- **No speculation** — Housing never becomes an investment vehicle. There are no bubbles, no flipping, and no NIMBYism driven by property value protection.
- **Maintenance coherence** — A single owner maintains consistent standards across the entire built environment. No slumlords, no deferred-maintenance condo boards, no fragmented responsibility.
- **Frictionless mobility** — Residents move between unit sizes as life circumstances change (single to couple to family to downsizer) without real estate transaction costs.
- **Urban adaptation** — Buildings can be retrofitted or replaced on engineering timelines, not negotiation timelines.

### Trade-offs

The no-ownership model has real costs that the economic model must explicitly address:

- **No equity building** — Residents pay monthly but accumulate no property wealth. This removes the primary wealth-building mechanism most people rely on. The retirement fund (Section 4) directly compensates for this.
- **Reduced stewardship** — People invest less care in spaces they don't own. Mitigated by community culture, pod-level governance, and responsive city maintenance.
- **Governance risk** — Whoever controls licensing controls housing. Mitigated by resident councils, transparent policy, eviction protections, and rent caps (see Vision Document, Governance section).
- **Retention fragility** — No ownership stake means lower switching cost to leave. The vesting retirement benefit (Section 4) creates a compelling reason to stay.

## 2. License Fee Structure

Each resident pays a single monthly **license fee** that bundles all costs of living in the city. There are no separate bills.

### Included in the license fee

- Housing (unit occupation)
- All utilities (electricity, water, heating/cooling, waste)
- Data connectivity (WiFi/5G mesh)
- Package and grocery delivery (automated underground logistics)
- Waste removal
- Access to all shared amenities (co-working, libraries, recreation, parks)
- Basic healthcare access
- Maintenance of unit and common areas

### Fee components (internal allocation)

The license fee is a single number to the resident, but internally the city allocates it across four funds:

| Component | Purpose | Approximate share |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Operating fund** | Day-to-day city operations, staffing, services | 40% |
| **Maintenance reserve** | Building and infrastructure upkeep, replacement cycles | 25% |
| **Debt service** | Construction financing repayment | 20% |
| **Retirement fund** | Resident elder care entitlement (Section 4) | 15% |

These ratios shift over time. As construction debt is retired (30-year horizon), the debt service share decreases and can be redirected to the maintenance reserve and sovereign wealth fund.

## 3. The Maintenance Inflation Problem

Infrastructure and buildings degrade. Maintenance costs compound over time:

- Buildings require increasing intervention as they age (facade repair, mechanical system replacement, structural remediation).
- Underground infrastructure (vehicle lanes, utility corridors, water/sewage mains) has 30-50 year replacement cycles.
- Materials and labor costs rise with general inflation.
- Technology upgrades (solar panels, battery storage, automation systems) require periodic capital investment.

If the city's only revenue source is license fees, those fees must rise to match — which is functionally rent inflation without the equity upside that property owners enjoy. This is the worst of both worlds if not addressed with external revenue.

### Revenue streams beyond license fees

The city must generate revenue that grows independently of its residential population:

**Energy export.** The solar ring and rooftop generation produce surplus power (44% above city demand per the technical spec). Surplus energy is sold to the external grid. As battery technology improves and solar efficiency increases, this surplus grows. Revenue scales with energy markets, not with resident count.

**Commercial licensing.** Businesses operating within the city pay commercial license fees scaled to revenue, not fixed rent. If the city economy grows, commercial revenue grows organically. The city's incentive aligns with making the city a great place to do business.

**City as equity partner.** The city provides space, infrastructure, and a captive market to businesses in exchange for small equity stakes or revenue-sharing agreements. A portfolio approach — most ventures are modest, some succeed significantly. This is a sovereign wealth fund seeded by proximity rather than natural resources.

**Sovereign wealth fund.** A portion of all surplus revenue is invested externally from day one. Returns compound independently of the city's physical maintenance costs. The fund serves as a buffer against demographic shifts, unexpected capital needs, and maintenance cost spikes. Modeled after Singapore's GIC or Norway's Government Pension Fund.

**Compute and data services.** Underground infrastructure can house data center capacity. The city sells compute services externally, leveraging its surplus solar generation for competitive energy costs.

**Hospitality and tourism.** A city with no cars, automated logistics, and walkable design is a destination. Visitor accommodations and experience fees generate external revenue.

## 4. Retirement Fund

### The equity replacement

In a conventional housing market, residents build equity through mortgage payments. That equity becomes their primary retirement asset — sold or reverse-mortgaged to fund elder care. The no-ownership model eliminates this pathway.

The retirement fund replaces it with something more reliable: a **vested entitlement to lifetime elder care**, funded by a dedicated component of every resident's license fee.

### How it works

Every resident's license fee includes a retirement fund contribution (approximately 15% of the fee). This contribution is pooled city-wide and managed as an actuarial fund. It is not a savings account — it is a risk pool, like insurance, but without external profit extraction.

When a resident reaches the age or condition requiring assisted living or nursing care, they transition to city-operated elder care facilities with **all costs covered for life**. This includes:

- Independent senior housing (aging-in-place units with accessibility features)
- Assisted living (daily living support, meals, social programming)
- Nursing care (full-time medical and personal care)
- Memory care (specialized dementia/Alzheimer's support)
- End-of-life/hospice care

### Why this is better than property equity

- **Property equity is unreliable.** Housing markets crash, maintenance erodes value, and selling under duress (health crisis) means accepting bad prices. A care entitlement is deterministic — the resident knows exactly what they receive.
- **No liquidation problem.** Property owners must sell or reverse-mortgage to access their equity, often at the worst possible time. The retirement benefit simply activates when needed.
- **Pooled risk.** Some residents need 10 years of intensive care; some need none. The city absorbs that variance across its entire population, the way an insurer would, but without profit extraction or coverage denials.
- **No gap between asset and need.** Property equity is denominated in dollars; care is denominated in services. Converting one to the other involves intermediaries, market risk, and uncertainty. The city provides the services directly.

### Vesting schedule

The retirement benefit vests over time, creating both fairness and retention:

| Years of residency | Coverage level |
|--------------------|---------------|
| 0-4 years | No coverage (contribution refunded if resident departs) |
| 5-9 years | 25% coverage (city subsidizes 25% of care costs; resident or external insurance covers remainder) |
| 10-14 years | 50% coverage |
| 15-19 years | 75% coverage |
| 20+ years | 100% coverage (full lifetime care, no additional cost) |

Residents who leave the city before vesting receive a partial refund of their contributions (minus administrative costs). Residents who leave after partial vesting retain their vested percentage as a claim they can activate if they return.

### Retention effect

The vesting schedule transforms the no-ownership model from a liability into an advantage. A resident with 12 years in the city has a vested 50% elder care benefit worth potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars. Leaving forfeits the unvested portion. This is a powerful but humane retention mechanism — the handcuffs are "we will take care of you when you are old."

### Actuarial sustainability

The city has structural advantages over commercial insurers:

- **It owns and operates the care facilities.** No third-party markup on assisted living or nursing care. Construction, staffing, and operations are at cost.
- **It controls the built environment.** Universal accessibility, aging-in-place unit design, and walkable neighborhoods reduce care needs and delay the transition to intensive care.
- **No adverse selection.** Every resident participates. There is no opt-out that would leave only high-risk individuals in the pool.
- **Preventive care incentive.** The city saves money by keeping residents healthy longer. This creates a direct financial incentive to invest in healthcare access, walkability, clean air, nutrition, and fitness infrastructure — things conventional cities treat as costs but which here are investments against future care liabilities.
- **Demographic management.** The city controls admission through licensing. It can maintain a healthy ratio of working-age to retired residents, preventing the demographic tilt that threatens national pension systems.
- **Long runway.** A new city starts with zero retirees. The first cohort won't reach elder care age for 20-30 years, providing decades to build the fund before significant claims begin.

### Demographic risk mitigation

The primary risk is an aging population overwhelming the fund. Mitigations:

- **Admission policy** maintains demographic balance (see Vision Document, Population Model).
- **Sovereign wealth fund** provides a financial buffer independent of the retirement fund.
- **Graduated care model** keeps residents independent longer through accessible design and preventive health investment, reducing per-capita care costs.
- **External revenue streams** (energy export, commercial licensing, compute services) can supplement the fund if demographic ratios shift.

## 5. Commercial Tenant Model

Businesses in the city operate under commercial licenses, not property leases. Key differences from the residential model:

- **Revenue-scaled fees.** Commercial license fees are calculated as a percentage of revenue rather than a fixed rate per square meter. This aligns the city's incentive with business success and prevents the failure cascade that fixed-rent commercial districts experience during economic downturns.
- **Curated mix.** The city manages the commercial mix to ensure each pod has the services its residents need. This is a feature of the no-ownership model — the city can prioritize a grocery store over a luxury boutique if the pod needs one.
- **Equity participation.** For larger ventures, the city may negotiate equity stakes or revenue-sharing agreements in exchange for favorable license terms, buildout support, or guaranteed customer base access.
- **No vacancy cost.** Since the city owns all commercial space, unused space costs the city nothing in mortgage payments. This removes the pressure to fill space with any tenant and allows the city to hold space for the right fit.

## 6. Financial Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Construction and early operation (Years 0-10)

- Primary revenue: residential and commercial license fees
- Primary cost: construction debt service, initial operations
- Retirement fund: accumulating, no significant claims
- Sovereign wealth fund: seeded with surplus

### Phase 2: Maturation (Years 10-25)

- Debt service decreasing as construction loans amortize
- Energy export revenue growing as solar technology improves
- Commercial ecosystem maturing, revenue-scaled fees increasing
- Retirement fund growing; early partial-vesting claims beginning
- Sovereign wealth fund compounding

### Phase 3: Steady state (Years 25+)

- Construction debt fully retired; that 20% of license fee reallocated
- Maintenance reserve becomes the primary capital cost
- Retirement fund entering full claims period for first-generation residents
- Sovereign wealth fund providing supplemental income
- External revenue streams (energy, compute, commercial equity) offsetting maintenance inflation
