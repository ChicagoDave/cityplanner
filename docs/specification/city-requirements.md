# City Requirements

## Design Principles
- **Car-free city**. No streets, no roads, no parking. All surface space between buildings is pedestrian — paths, courtyards, gardens, plazas.
- Three vertical layers of surface movement: elevated bike paths (~5m), ground-level pedestrian/shuttle paths, and UG 1 underground pathways.

## Population & Scale
- **Target population**: ~64,000
- **Total pods**: 40
- **Population per pod**: ~1,600
- **City diameter**: ~4.4 km (city proper), ~6 km with external band
- **City area**: ~15 km² (city proper), ~28 km² with external band

## Vertical Structure

### Above Ground
- Pod construction at surface level, with height determined by concentric ring (2 to 32 stories).

### Underground Levels
The city has multiple underground levels:

| Level | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Underground 1** | Public space connecting pods; pedestrian pathways, gathering areas. Pod basements open directly onto this level. |
| **Underground 2** | Automated freight/delivery systems, mechanical/maintenance infrastructure |
| **Underground 3** | Infrastructure (conduits, pipes, battery storage) |

## Concentric Ring Layout

Construction is organized in concentric circles radiating from the city center, with density increasing inward:

| Ring | Stories | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **External band** (outside city boundary) | N/A | Solar arrays, water treatment, waste treatment, highway connections, airport connections |
| **Ring 1** (outermost) | 2 | Lower density |
| **Ring 2** | 4 | |
| **Ring 3** | 8 | |
| **Ring 4** | 16 | |
| **Center** | 32 | |

## Pods

### Pod Types
- Family
- Couples
- Individual
- Work
- Social
- Event
- Library
- Grocery
- Commercial
- Medical / Clinic
- Childcare / Daycare
- Fitness / Recreation
- Dining / Restaurant
- Education / School
- Worship / Meditation
- Arts / Performance
- Emergency Services

### Pod Definition
A pod is a self-contained neighborhood that includes all the elements of daily life — residential, commercial, dining, medical, childcare, education, etc. mixed together. People can live their daily life within their pod.

### Pod Scale
- Each pod supports ~1,600 residents.
- Each pod contains one K-8 school (up to 200 students).

### City-Wide Education
- 40 K-8 schools (one per pod, ~200 students each).
- 4 high schools (grades 9-12, ~800 students each).
- 1-2 community colleges (trades and liberal arts).

### Housing Unit Mix (per pod, ~750 units)

| Unit Type | Size | Units | Avg Occupancy | People | % |
|-----------|------|-------|---------------|--------|---|
| 1BR | ~55 m² | 300 | 1.2 | 360 | 40% |
| 2BR | ~85 m² | 250 | 2.0 | 500 | 33% |
| 3BR | ~110 m² | 140 | 3.5 | 490 | 18% |
| 4BR | ~140 m² | 55 | 4.0 | 220 | 7% |
| 5BR | ~170 m² | 8 | 5.0 | 40 | 2% |

Total built floor area per pod: ~72,000 m² (residential ~62,000 m² + non-residential ~10,000 m²).

### Pod Form Factors by Ring

Same population, same amenities — different physical form based on ring height:

| Ring | Stories | Pod Diameter | Character |
|------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Ring 1 | 2 | ~360m | Sprawling campus, townhouses, courtyards |
| Ring 2 | 4 | ~255m | Mid-rise blocks, gardens |
| Ring 3 | 8 | ~180m | Urban mid-rise, mixed-use buildings |
| Ring 4 | 16 | ~130m | High-rise towers with podium retail |
| Center | 32 | ~90m | Compact vertical towers, dense plazas |

Building coverage ~35%. Remaining ground area is paths, courtyards, and green space (no streets).

### Pod Design Rules
- Pods do not have a strict outline; they only need to be cohesive in form.
- 50 meters of open park/grass space between all non-commercial pods.
- Pod basements connect to Underground 1 public pathways, giving residents direct access to the underground public realm.

## Sports & Recreation

### Large Fields
- 1 stadium / outdoor event field (football-sized, doubles for concerts and ceremonies). Centrally located.
- 10 soccer/cricket fields distributed across the city (~1 per 4 pods).

### Small Courts
- Basketball, tennis, and pickleball courts scattered throughout the 50m green buffers between pods.

## Transport

### Automated Shuttles
- Battery-powered automated vehicles seating up to 10 passengers.
- On-demand (callable) or running regular routes.
- Stations distributed throughout the city.
- Full handicap accessibility.
- Operate on surface paths and/or UG 1 pathways.

### Delivery System
- Automated, low-maintenance freight system (technology TBD — to be engineered for reliability and simplicity).
- Routes from city edge to center and out to individual pods.
- Operates on Underground 2.

## Pathways

### Bike Paths
- Elevated bike paths bridged ~5m above ground, threading between and over pods.
- Heated concrete surface to prevent ice formation (radiant heating, proven technology).
- Can connect directly into buildings at upper floors in taller rings.
- Also run below ground through UG 1.
- Weave through all parts of the city and extend out to the countryside.

### Pedestrian Paths
- Include separated walk and run lanes.
- Move above and below ground throughout the city.

## Construction Standards

### Windows
- All construction uses floor-to-ceiling weather-related windows.
- Double-paned glass for cold climates.
- Auto-darkening capability.

## Rendering Approach

### Pipeline
1. Start with pods and pathways (bike, pedestrian, transport).
2. Produce 2D floor plans first.
3. Then generate 3D plans from the 2D output.
