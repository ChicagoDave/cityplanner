# Charter City — Vision Document

**A Car-Free, Solar-Powered, Specification-Designed City**

David Cornelson | February 2026

## Executive Summary

This document describes the vision for a purpose-built charter city of 50,000 residents designed from first principles. The city eliminates automobiles, generates its own power, delivers all goods through automated underground logistics, and operates on an all-inclusive rental model with no private property ownership. Every aspect of the city is defined through specification and generated computationally rather than drawn by hand.

The core premise is that modern cities are built around constraints that no longer serve their residents: roads designed for cars, infrastructure retrofitted rather than planned, and zoning that separates rather than integrates daily life. By starting from scratch on an excavated site, every system can be designed as a coherent whole.

## Core Design Principles

### No Roads or Parking

There are no roads, streets, or parking facilities anywhere within city limits. This single constraint reclaims approximately 30-40% of the land area that a conventional city dedicates to automobile infrastructure. That space is redirected to parks, plazas, gardens, and building footprint. Emergency and service access is handled entirely through the underground automated vehicle network.

### Segregated Pedestrian and Bicycle Ways

Dedicated pedestrian and bicycle pathways operate both above and below ground throughout the city. These networks are designed for human-powered movement and are the primary mode of transportation for all residents. The surface level is entirely human-scale, with no vehicle conflicts of any kind.

### Underground Automated Vehicle Network

Autonomous electric vehicles operate primarily below ground, handling all freight delivery, waste removal, emergency response, and maintenance logistics. Vehicles may traverse ground level only for servicing outdoor spaces such as parks and event areas. The underground network is the circulatory system of the city, invisible to daily life on the surface.

### Proximity of Essential Services

Every residential area has grocery, library, and public commerce facilities within a five-minute walk (approximately 400 meters). This is achieved through a neighborhood pod design where each pod is a self-contained community with all essential daily services.

### Co-Working Over Dedicated Offices

There are no dedicated corporate office buildings. All professional work happens in reservable co-working spaces distributed throughout the city. This eliminates commuting pressure, removes the need for a central business district, and ensures that most residents can walk to work in under five minutes.

### Solar-First Energy

Every upward-facing surface in the city is a solar collector: every roof, canopy, elevated walkway cover, and park structure. The city is supplemented by a solar farm ring surrounding the perimeter. The target is net-zero or net-positive annual energy production with 24-hour battery storage backup. There is no natural gas infrastructure. The city is entirely electric.

### No Ownership

All property in the city is owned by the city entity. Residents and businesses lease their spaces. Rent is all-inclusive, bundling housing, utilities, delivery, waste removal, data connectivity, and access to all shared amenities. This eliminates real estate speculation, simplifies the financial model, and ensures every unit exists to house a resident rather than serve as an investment vehicle.

### Bowl Height Profile

Building heights progress from low at the city edge to tall at the center, creating a bowl-shaped skyline. This ensures no resident's view of the surrounding landscape is blocked, optimizes solar exposure by minimizing self-shading, provides natural wayfinding through the height gradient, and improves wind flow through the city.

## City Structure

### Concentric Ring Model

The city is organized in concentric rings from center to edge, each with a distinct character, density, and service profile.

**Center (0-300m radius):** The tallest buildings and the civic/commercial core. City hall, performing arts center, hospital, major event spaces, specialized commerce, and the highest concentration of co-working hubs. This is where visitors arrive via underground transit from the perimeter and where city-wide gatherings take place. Maximum building height: 20 stories.

**Middle Ring (300-600m radius):** Mid-rise mixed-use development. Secondary schools, diverse retail, restaurants, entertainment, medical facilities. Home to singles, couples, and empty nesters who want walkable urban life. Most co-working spaces concentrate here for accessibility from both edge and center. Maximum building height: 10 stories.

**Edge Ring (600-900m radius):** Low-rise, family-focused neighborhoods. Elementary schools, playgrounds, libraries, pediatric clinics, daycares. More green space per capita, quieter environment. Children have the most direct access to the surrounding landscape. Maximum building height: 4 stories.

**Perimeter Infrastructure (900-1100m radius):** Below-grade facilities invisible from the surface: sewage treatment, water treatment, freight staging, vehicle maintenance, electrical substation, and grid interconnect. Hidden from view so the city presents clean from every angle.

**Solar Ring (1100-1500m radius):** Utility-scale solar farm encircling the city, generating the supplemental power needed to achieve net-zero energy. Also serves as a natural buffer between the city and surrounding land.

### Neighborhood Pods

The city is divided into approximately 13 neighborhood pods, each centered on a 400-meter walk radius. Pods in different rings have different characters:

- **Edge pods:** Centered on families, education, and libraries. Population around 3,000 with shared services across adjacent pods.
- **Middle pods:** Mixed demographic, higher density, more diverse commercial offerings. Population around 4,000-5,000.
- **Center pods:** Highest density, civic and cultural focus. Population around 5,000-6,000.

Each pod must independently satisfy minimum service thresholds for its required amenities or share services with adjacent pods where population falls below individual thresholds.

## Population Model

### Target Population: 50,000

The city targets 50,000 residents, a number chosen because it clears nearly every service viability threshold (grocery, schools, hospital, library system, diverse retail), supports economic diversity without excessive governance complexity, and sits in the sweet spot where per-capita infrastructure cost is financeable while the population is achievable to recruit and house.

### Demographic Mix

The city maintains deliberate demographic balance through its admission process:

- Singles: 15% of households
- Couples: 20% of households
- Young families (children under 12): 25% of households
- Teen families (children 12-18): 15% of households
- Empty nesters: 15% of households
- Retirees: 10% of households

### Household and Family Guidelines

Households may include up to three generations in direct lineage (e.g., parents, children, and a grandparent) but not extended family clusters. Related households are not guaranteed adjacency. These guardrails prevent cultural enclaving and ensure each pod maintains demographic diversity. Detailed policies require development by social planning experts and legal counsel.

### Admission Model

Given the city's appeal to remote workers, families, retirees, environmentally motivated individuals, and people priced out of major metros, demand is expected to significantly exceed supply. The resulting waiting list enables demographic curation, phased construction funded by proven demand, and the ability to demonstrate market viability to investors through committed deposits.

Selection criteria, fairness mechanisms, and legal compliance require expert development and are marked as open items in the specification.

## Infrastructure Systems

### Full Excavation Approach

Rather than tunneling, the entire city footprint is excavated to depth and the underground level is built as a planned infrastructure floor. The surface is then constructed on a structural platform above. This approach allows rational grid layout for all underground systems, dramatically reduces cost compared to tunnel boring, enables layered separation of vehicle lanes, utilities, and water/sewage systems, and produces the surface as a constructed slab with pre-planned penetrations for tree wells, drainage, elevator access, and freight delivery points.

Excavation depth of 8-10 meters accommodates three functional layers: sewage and water mains at the bottom (gravity-dependent), utility corridors in the middle (electrical, telecom, accessible for maintenance), and vehicle lanes on top (maximum height clearance).

### Water and Sewage

Water supply enters at the perimeter from municipal connection, well field, or reservoir, is treated at a perimeter plant, and distributes inward through trunk lines branching to each pod with risers into buildings. Capacity is calculated at approximately 100 gallons per person per day.

Wastewater flows in reverse via gravity toward the perimeter treatment plant. The slight grade is built into the underground slab during construction. Treated effluent is either discharged or recycled for irrigation and non-potable use.

Stormwater is captured on the constructed surface through bioswales and drain penetrations, managed in underground retention, then treated or discharged.

### Electrical and Solar Generation

The city is entirely electric with no natural gas. This eliminates gas mains, risers, metering, combustion ventilation, and an entire category of emergency response.

Solar generation comes from two sources: integrated panels on every upward-facing surface in the city (approximately 200 hectares generating an average of 80 MW) and the surrounding solar farm ring (approximately 250 hectares generating an average of 100 MW). Total average generation of 180 MW exceeds the estimated 125 MW average demand (50,000 people at 2.5 kW per capita for all-electric), providing a 44% surplus on average days.

Battery storage of 3,000 MWh (24 hours of capacity) is distributed in underground pod-level battery rooms at approximately 230 MWh per pod. A bidirectional grid connection serves as backup for extended low-solar periods and allows surplus export for revenue.

### Wireless and Induction Infrastructure

The city minimizes physical cabling through two technologies:

**Induction surfaces:** Floors, countertops, and desks serve as power delivery surfaces, dramatically simplifying last-meter electrical distribution within buildings. Vehicle lanes embed inductive charging coils so autonomous vehicles charge while moving, eliminating dedicated charging infrastructure.

**Wireless mesh networking:** WiFi 6E and 5G small cells on 75-meter spacing replace fiber-to-the-unit with fiber-to-the-node, reducing telecom cable runs by 80-90%. Only a backbone fiber trunk is needed with periodic node breakouts.

This reduces utility corridor width from 3m to 2.5m across the entire city, reclaiming underground space.

## Automated Logistics

### Package Delivery

Individual parcels arrive at perimeter freight staging from external trucks, are sorted by pod in an automated sortation facility, loaded onto small autonomous vehicles (golf-cart sized, inductive-charged), and routed underground to destination pods. At the pod delivery hub, residents pick up from locker banks or smaller bots bring items to building-level pickup points via freight elevator. Estimated daily volume: 75,000 packages (1.5 per person per day, conservative given the car-free environment where residents order more online).

### Bulk Delivery

Grocery restocking, restaurant supplies, construction materials, furniture, and appliance deliveries enter through perimeter loading docks, load onto larger autonomous flatbed vehicles, and route directly to commercial loading areas in each pod's underground level. Shops and grocery stores receive stock from below; customers never see a truck or dolly.

### Waste and Recycling

The system runs in reverse for outbound material. Building chutes and collection points drop waste to the underground level where autonomous vehicles collect and route to perimeter processing facilities. Streams include trash, recycling, compost, and hazardous materials. Collection runs daily per pod, often using return trips from delivery vehicles.

### Delivery Included in Rent

All in-city delivery is bundled into rent. The fleet operates whether carrying one package or a hundred; marginal cost per additional parcel is near zero. This is infrastructure, not a per-use service, treated the same as elevator maintenance in a conventional apartment building.

## Financial Model

### Revenue Model

The city operates as a single landlord. All revenue comes from residential and commercial leases. Residential rent bundles housing, all utilities, delivery, waste removal, data connectivity, amenity access, and maintenance into a single monthly payment. Commercial tenants pay per square meter with similar all-inclusive terms. The city curates the commercial mix to ensure each pod has the services its residents need.

### Cost Structure

Estimated total construction cost is $5-8 billion, including excavation ($735M at 21M cubic meters at $35/m³), platform slab and waterproofing, underground infrastructure (vehicle lanes, utility corridors, battery storage), all buildings and surface infrastructure, solar farm ring, and perimeter facilities.

At $6B financed over 30 years at 5%, annual debt service is approximately $385M. Adding $100M for annual operations, 20,000 housing units require roughly $2,000/month average rent to break even. This is competitive with many US metro areas, and the all-inclusive model eliminates car payments, gas, insurance, utility bills, and delivery fees that would otherwise add $800-1,200/month to a conventional household's expenses.

### Phased Construction

The city builds from center outward. Phase 1 delivers the center and inner middle ring (approximately 15,000 residents, 6,000 units), which is self-sustaining for core services. Revenue from Phase 1 residents funds Phase 2 (outer middle ring, 15,000 additional residents). Phase 2 revenue funds Phase 3 (edge ring, 20,000 additional residents). Each phase is de-risked by the demonstrated demand from the waiting list.

## Governance

Governance design is identified as requiring specialized expertise in social planning and legal counsel. The specification captures principles and constraints while marking detailed policy as an open item.

### Principles

- Residents have meaningful civic voice without property ownership as the basis for participation.
- Demographic diversity is maintained across all pods.
- Admission criteria are transparent and legally compliant.
- No cultural enclaving; shared spaces remain shared.
- Rent increases are capped and eviction protections are robust.
- Major decisions are subject to resident input through mechanisms such as elected pod councils, a city-wide elected council, participatory budgeting, and referenda.

### Open Items

- Detailed governance structure (requires social planning expert)
- Legal framework for non-ownership residency model
- Admission selection mechanism (weighted lottery, application, hybrid)
- Family clustering prevention policies (requires legal review for fair housing compliance)
- Resident rights and protections framework

## Site Selection and Jurisdiction

### Site Requirements

The city requires a minimum of 800 hectares (city footprint plus solar ring plus buffer) of flat terrain with a water table below excavation depth, stable non-bedrock soil, low seismic risk, solar irradiance above 4.5 kWh/m²/day, low flood risk, electrical grid within 10km, water source within 20km, major road within 5km for freight entry, and international airport within 100km.

### Jurisdiction Strategy

US regulatory environment presents significant obstacles: car-centric zoning laws, Fair Housing Act complexity around demographic curation, overlapping municipal/county/state jurisdictions, lengthy environmental review processes, and cultural resistance to the no-ownership model.

The initial build is more feasible in Mexico (Special Economic Zones, lower construction costs, growing remote worker population) or Canada (receptive to experimental urban planning, existing universal healthcare, frameworks for planned communities). The specific location is determined pragmatically by whichever jurisdiction offers the best terms for what is essentially a charter city.

The host jurisdiction negotiation seeks: regulatory authority for self-governance within the development, tax incentives during construction, autonomy over the ownership model, permission to operate the autonomous vehicle network, and control over residency criteria within applicable legal frameworks.

A successful first city outside the US becomes leverage for domestic expansion, backed by demonstrated demand, operational data, and a waiting list of American residents.

## The Design Tool

No existing urban planning tool accommodates this city's constraints. The vision requires a purpose-built specification-driven design engine.

### Specification-Driven Design

The city is never drawn by hand. All aspects are defined declaratively in a specification document. The engine reads the specification, solves constraints, generates geometry, and outputs a navigable 3D model. The design loop is: write spec, generate, evaluate, adjust spec, regenerate.

### Engine Architecture

The engine follows a four-stage pipeline:

**Spec:** Declarative YAML/JSON input defining all city parameters: population, demographics, ring assignments, service thresholds, infrastructure systems, height constraints, and site geometry.

**Solver:** Constraint satisfaction engine that distributes population across pods, validates service thresholds, routes infrastructure networks with capacity constraints, sizes treatment plants and substations, and lays out vehicle lanes avoiding utility corridor conflicts.

**Scene Graph:** The solver's output organized into a traversable 3D spatial structure with every pipe, wall, lane, building, and path having a position, dimension, and material.

**Renderer:** A 3D visualization engine similar to game systems like Doom, enabling first-person walkthrough at street level, underground exploration of vehicle lanes and pipe runs, layer toggling, cross-section views, and level-of-detail from city-wide overview to individual pipe junctions.

### Next Steps

With the vision and specification framework established, the next phase is defining the engine architecture in detail: the solver algorithms, the scene graph structure, the procedural geometry generation, and the renderer implementation. This is the tool that makes the city designable.
